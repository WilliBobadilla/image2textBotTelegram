This is an example of text that is not
{ully justifed, just aligned. Notice how
the right margin varies slightly,
although the block fills up as well as it
â€˜can using the default spacing,

This is fully justified text. Notice how
the extra space at the ends of the
lines is redistributed between the
letters so that both margins are
absolutely equal.
